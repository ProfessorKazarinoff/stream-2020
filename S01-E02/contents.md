 - Anaconda Distribution of Python
 - VS Code
 - PuTTY and PuTTY Gen

## Talk SSH keys and use PuTTY Gen to create an SSH key

## Talk Virtual Private Servers, log into Linode and create a new server

## Talk SSH and log into the server over SSH

## Create a non-root sudo user on the server and copy over SSH keys into the non-root sudo user's account, modify ufw firewall, save history

## Log into the server as non-root sudo user, save history

## Add history files to git, commit and push

## Decide to do DNS and domain names or install MiniConda, Python Packages, JupyterHub

## Install Miniconda on server, set up jupyterhubenv conda env, install jupyter, numpy, pandas, xlrd, matplotlib, sympy, requests, bokeh, altair, jupyter-hub. Save history
