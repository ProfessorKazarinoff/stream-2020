## Review what we did last time

 - Routed our domain name to Linode name servers
 - Added an A record in Linode domains dashboard to link our domain name to our server IP address
 - Installed Miniconda, created conda env
 - Installed conda packages, JupyterHub
 - Ran JupyterHub in a very unsecure fashion
 - Aquired an SSL cert using Certbot

## Create files for security

 - Note: run ```# starting S01-E04``` as first command. Put ```# generate proxy auth token``` before typing sets of commands
 - proxy auth token
 - cookie secret
 - dhparams.pem

## Install nginx and configure

 - install Nginx
 - create Nginx configuration (maybe mess around locally and move it with ftp)

## JupyterHub as a system service

## Test JupyterHub running in SSL with Nginx as a reverse proxy

## Save History, Shut down server

## Add files to git, commit and push

## Review and Preview Next Episode
